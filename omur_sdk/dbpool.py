"""asyncpg pool helper that enforces a Postgres role via the init coroutine.

Runs ``SET ROLE <role>`` on every new physical connection so the role is
guaranteed even across reconnects — the async equivalent of pgx's
``AfterConnect`` hook. This is the defence-in-depth mechanism we rely on
after removing PgBouncer (which previously took care of the role reset via
``server_reset_query``).
